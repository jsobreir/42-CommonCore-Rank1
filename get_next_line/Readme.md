# Get_next_line
Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

The goal of this project is to create a function that returns a line read from a file descriptot. This project taught me about static variables, and further improved my skills in  finding and solving memory leaks and understanding of file descriptors.

## Documentation

## Installing and Using
To download, clone the repository into your device and navigate inside using 'cd get_next_line', then typing 'make' to compile all the functions and generate the library archive, which you will then need to implement these fucntion in your own project.

To compile a program with the get_next_line.a library, you can compile the program as follows:

```
cc ./program_name.c -L/path/to/get_next_line -lft -o program_name
```
